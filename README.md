# Tic Tac Toe
 Creating a Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can be broken down into several steps. Here's a simplified outline of the process, including the structure of the files you mentioned: store.js, app.js, view.js, and index.css.

# 1. Set Up Your Files and Project Structure:

Create the following files in a directory for your project:

index.html: The main HTML file that will include your game content.
index.css: The CSS file for styling your game.
store.js: JavaScript file for managing the game state.
app.js: JavaScript file for handling game logic.
view.js: JavaScript file for updating the user interface.
# 2. Design the HTML Structure:
In your index.html file, set up the basic structure of your game board using HTML elements. Create a 3x3 grid for the Tic Tac Toe board using a table or div elements.
# 3. Style the Game with CSS (index.css):
Style your game using CSS in the index.css file. Customize the appearance of the game board, cells, and any other elements you want to enhance visually.
# 4. Manage Game State (store.js):
In your store.js file, you can create an object to manage the game state. This can include information about the current player, the board layout, and any other relevant data.
# 5. Implement Game Logic (app.js):
In your app.js file, you'll implement the game logic functions. This includes handling moves, checking for a win/draw, and updating the game state.
# 6. Update User Interface (view.js):
In your view.js file, write functions to update the user interface based on the game state stored in gameStore.
# 7. Connect JavaScript with HTML:
In your view.js file, you'll use JavaScript to interact with the HTML elements and update the UI when game events occur.
